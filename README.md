Investigation of technological vulnerabilities in web applications and databases

# Summary

Modern society relies on web technologies, but with their growing popularity the risk of their use increases. 
Web applications make life easier for users and businesses, but their popularity makes them an important and 
common target for hackers who focus on their main flaw - the presence of vulnerabilities. In this thesis I 
study the way of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities, with the ultimate goal to take measures to maintain 
protection.

The percentage of cybercrime is increasing with each passing day and that is why it is very important to know 
the current statistics and trends in cybersecurity. Numerous reports show that vulnerabilities in web applications 
continue to be the main cause of security and data breaches. Within the thesis you can find some of the most risky 
data breaches in the 21st century, many of which were possible by gaps in web applications. For exmaple:

* Yahoo! - Cookie hijacking;
* Adult Friend Finder - Local File Inclusion vulnerability;
* Heartland Payment Systems - SQL Injection;
* Anthem - Phishing link;
* RSA Security - Series of phishing attacks;
* Bulgarian National Revenue Agency - Vulnerability of one of the e-services for VAT refund;

The process of conducting complex cyberattacks can be described as the life cycle of an attack, which consists 
of several steps. Following a methodology is not mandatory, but gives a better and more effective result. There 
is a detailed description of each step of the attack lifecycle in a separate chapter. The practical part of the 
thesis covers the phases Reconnaissance, Scanning and Exploitation. The other phases are not in the scope 
of this thesis. 

Before continueing with a brief overview of the three attacks, thoroughly explained in the thesis, let's clarify 
few concepts:

* Vulnerability - a technological flaw that allows hackers to experiment and possibly successfully compromise the 
security of a target system;

* Exploit - program code, part of software, a piece of data or a sequence of commands that allows a malicious person 
to take advantage of a technological vulnerability;

* Payload - the modules that are launched on the victim system if an exploit has been performed successfully;
